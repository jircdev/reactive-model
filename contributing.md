# Contributing to BeyondJS Library

First off, thank you for considering contributing to our BeyondJS Library. It's people like you that make the
open-source community such a fantastic place to learn, inspire, and create.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before you can contribute to the BeyondJS Library, you need to set up your development environment. Here's how:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jircdev/reactive-model.git
cd reactive-model
```
````

````markdown
2. **Install dependencies** for both the library and the test suite:

-   For the library:

```bash
cd library
npm install
```
````

-   For the test suite:

```bash
cd tests
npm install
```

````

This command installs all the necessary dependencies for the library and the test suite.

## Running the Development Server

BeyondJS utilizes a development server to run and test libraries locally. To start the server:

1. **Run the BeyondJS CLI command** in the root directory of your project (where the `beyond.json` file is located):

```bash
beyond run
````

2. **Access the development server** by navigating to:

```
http://localhost:950
```

You should now see the test project running, where you can interact with the `Users` and `Books` entities to test
different functionalities of the reactive model.

## Testing

The `/tests` directory contains separate packages to test various use cases of the library. When you write tests:

1. **Navigate to the tests directory**:

```bash
cd tests
```

2. **Run your tests** to ensure your changes don't break existing functionality. Instructions on how to run these tests
   should be included in the `tests` directory's README file.

## Submitting Changes

Once you've made your changes:

1. **Push your changes** to a new branch in your forked repository.
2. **Create a pull request** with a clear title and description.

Your pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers, and they will provide feedback or merge it if everything checks
out.
