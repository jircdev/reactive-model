# Providers

**Providers** are a key concept in the ReactiveModel system. They allow you to decouple data access logic from the
reactive state itself. By implementing a simple interface, providers make it possible to integrate your models and
collections with any kind of data source ‚Äî from local storage and IndexedDB to SQL, NoSQL, REST APIs, or even file
systems.

---

## üéØ Purpose

The main goal of a provider is to **externalize persistence logic** so the reactive layer (items and collections) can
remain agnostic of how data is fetched, stored, or updated.

This enables:

-   Clean separation of concerns
-   Easier testing and mocking
-   Plug-and-play integration with various backends or storage engines
-   Uniform handling of local and remote data sources

---

## üîÅ Shared Concept

The provider concept is used in both:

-   [`Item<T>`](../item/) ‚Äî for single entity operations
-   [`Collection<T>`](../collection/) ‚Äî for group operations

While both rely on a provider, **each one requires a different interface**, suited to its purpose.

## üì¶ Item Providers

Used in the `Item<T>` class to interact with a single entity.  
You must implement the `IEntityProvider` interface:

```ts
export interface IItemProviderResponse<T> {
	status: number;
	data?: T;
	error?: string;
	errors?: Array<{
		field: string;
		message: string;
	}>;
}

export interface IEntityProvider {
	load?(specs?: any): Promise<any>;
	list?(specs?: any): Promise<any>; // Optional, for completeness
	publish?(data: any): Promise<any>;
	remove?(specs: any): Promise<any>;
	delete?(specs?: any): Promise<any>;
}
```
````

### Example

```ts
export class UserProvider {
	async load(id: string) {
		const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${id}`);
		return await response.json();
	}

	async publish(data) {
		const response = await fetch(`/api/users`, {
			method: 'POST',
			body: JSON.stringify(data),
		});
		return await response.json();
	}

	async delete(id: string) {
		return await fetch(`/api/users/${id}`, { method: 'DELETE' });
	}
}
```

## üìö Collection Providers

Used in the `Collection<T>` class to interact with a list of items.  
You must implement the `ICollectionProvider` interface:

```ts
export interface ICollectionProviderResponse<T> {
	status: number;
	data?: T;
	error?: string;
	errors?: Array<{
		field: string;
		message: string;
	}>;
}

export interface ICollectionProvider {
	load?(specs?: any): Promise<any>; // Optional (used in some setups)
	list(specs?: any): Promise<any>; // Required: fetches the list of items
	publish?(data: any): Promise<any>;
	remove?(specs?: any): Promise<any>;
}
```

### Example

```ts
export class UserCollectionProvider {
	async list(filters) {
		const params = new URLSearchParams(filters).toString();
		const response = await fetch(`/api/users?${params}`);
		return await response.json();
	}
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Benefits

-   ‚úÖ Agnostic of backend or storage engine
-   ‚úÖ Fully compatible with remote APIs or local storage
-   ‚úÖ Uniform interface for loading, saving, deleting
-   ‚úÖ Reusable and testable logic
-   ‚úÖ Scales from simple files to complex data layers

---

## üß™ Implementation Notes

-   All methods return `Promise<any>`. The return shape is not enforced strictly yet, but a standard response with
    `status`, `data`, or `error` is encouraged.
-   These interfaces are simple by design but will evolve in future versions to support advanced patterns like
    optimistic updates, error handling, and more detailed typing.

---

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

The current provider interfaces are intentionally minimal. Upcoming improvements may include:

-   Better typing for responses
-   Automatic retry logic
-   Lifecycle hooks
-   Centralized error handling

## üìÑ Summary

| Use Case      | Class           | Interface             |
| ------------- | --------------- | --------------------- |
| Single Entity | `Item<T>`       | `IEntityProvider`     |
| Collection    | `Collection<T>` | `ICollectionProvider` |

By following these simple interfaces, you can seamlessly integrate your models and collections with **any** data source,
while keeping your reactive logic clean and focused.
