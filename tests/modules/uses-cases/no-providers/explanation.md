# Item and Collection Without Providers

## Overview

The `updateACollection` function exemplifies a use case where `Item` and `Collection` classes operate independently of
any local or remote data providers. This setup tests the intrinsic functionalities of these classes, focusing on the
management of a collection of book items.

## Implementation Details

### Function: updateACollection

-   **Asynchronous Nature**: Designed to operate asynchronously, reflecting real-world data management scenarios.
-   **Objective**: Demonstrates handling a collection of book items, including instantiation, updating, and
    republishing.

#### Actions Performed

1. **Instantiation of Book Items**

    - Creates two new book items, 'Book A' and 'Book B', using the `Book` class.

2. **Publication of Items**

    - Publishes both items, checking for successful execution.

3. **Loading Collection**

    - Loads an existing collection of books using the `Books` class.

4. **Updating and Republishing Item**

    - Modifies 'Book B' to 'Book B Updated' and republishes it.

5. **Reloading Collection**
    - Reloads the collection to include the updated item.

### Code Structure and Logging

-   Involves detailed console logging at each step for tracking the process.
-   Implements response status checks for error handling.

## Core Functionalities Tested

-   **Creation**: Demonstrates the ability to create and instantiate new items.
-   **Update and Republish**: Showcases updating items within a collection and reflecting these changes.
-   **Load and Reload**: Tests loading and reloading capabilities of the collection to ensure data consistency.

## Conclusion

The `updateACollection` function effectively demonstrates the core capabilities of the `Item` and `Collection` classes
without reliance on external data providers. This approach is crucial for understanding the fundamental operations of
these classes and their potential applications in scenarios where direct data management is required.

# Use:

```ts
var { updateACollection } = await beyond.import('@beyond-js/reactive-tests/uses-cases/no-providers');
await updateACollection();
```
