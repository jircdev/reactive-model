# Object Extending Directly from ReactiveModel - testChanges

## Overview

The `testChanges` function is a practical implementation of an object extending from `ReactiveModel`. This case use
demonstrates the basic reactive functionalities and state management capabilities of the ReactiveModel by simulating
behaviors related to a blog article model.

## Implementation Details

### BlogArticleModel

-   Extends directly from `ReactiveModel`.
-   Manages properties such as 'content' and 'views' of a blog article.

### testChanges Function

-   A test function to illustrate the reactive features of `BlogArticleModel`.
-   It simulates real-time updates and listens to changes in the properties of the blog article.

#### Key Behaviors Simulated

1. **Content Update Listening**

    - Listens for changes to the 'content' property.
    - Logs updates to demonstrate reactivity.

2. **Views Update Listening**

    - Monitors changes to the 'views' property.
    - Logs each increment to indicate the reactive update mechanism.

3. **Content Update Simulation**

    - Uses `setTimeout` to simulate a delayed content update.
    - Illustrates asynchronous state changes in the model.

4. **Views Increment Simulation**
    - Implements `setInterval` to increment views at regular intervals.
    - Showcases continuous state updates in a reactive manner.

## Reactive Functionalities

-   The `on` method of `BlogArticleModel` enables the subscription to property changes.
-   Demonstrates real-time responsiveness to state changes within the model.
-   Ensures that updates to model properties are efficiently propagated and handled.

## Conclusion

This simulation exemplifies the robust reactive capabilities and state management of objects extending from
`ReactiveModel`. Through practical scenarios like updating blog article content and views, it highlights how the
ReactiveModel framework can be effectively utilized in real-world applications for dynamic data handling.
